# myFlix-client
Project Objective - 
Using React, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on
its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

The 5 Ws
Who — The users of your myFlix application. They will be movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading
information about different movies.

What — A single-page, responsive application with routing, rich interactions, several interface
views, and a polished user experience. The client-side developed in this Achievement will
support the existing server-side from Achievement 2 by facilitating user requests and
rendering the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.

When — myFlix users will be able to use it whenever they want to read information about
different movies or update their user information—for instance, their list of “Favorite Movies.”

Where — The application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and
can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.

Why — Movie enthusiasts like to be able to access information about different movies,
directors, and genres, whenever they want to. Having the ability to save lists of favorite
movies will ensure users always have access to the films they want to watch or recommend
to their peers.
